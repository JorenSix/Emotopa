h1. Emotopa

Emotopa is webapplication to extract pitch information from music. The current version is a hack for the "Music Hack Day India":https://musichackdayindia.github.io/

The idea is to develop a web based version of "Tarsos":https://github.com/JorenSix/Tarsos which is software to 'analyze and experiment with pitch organization in all kinds of musics'.

A first couple of building blocks have been implemented: audio decoding with ffmpeg, pitch extraction with yin and a kernel density estimate construction.

The name alludes to the "Apotome":https://isartum.net/apotome software. In that software you start from a scale to make audio, here you start from audio to make a scale. Emotopa is the reverse of Apotome.
